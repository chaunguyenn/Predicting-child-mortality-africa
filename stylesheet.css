texts and charts, with a goal to emphasize the main contents.

I set the main content to be in 55% width so that users can read more easily without 
having to move their eyes across the entire page. The use of alignment and white space 
helps to direct the users' focus into the main contents. By setting the width a 
flexible size and the margin auto, I allow the page to be responsive - doesn't matter 
the devices that the users are using to read the articles, all the information will 
be resize appropriately */

more evenly spaced and easier to read. 

Because I want to structure my article in an heirachy order, I style the h1,h2,h3,h4,
